## 🌟 Features  

- ❤️ **Confession Message Card** – A soft blurred-glass box with your love note.  
- 💕 **"Yes" Button** –  
  - Plays `love.mp3` when clicked.  
  - Shows a glowing `love.jpg` image in the background.  
  - Displays a sweet “Yay!” message.  
  - Floating hearts and your names appear together (e.g. *Tushar ❤️ Your Love*).  
- 💔 **"No" Button** –  
  - The button dodges the mouse pointer playfully (it moves when you get close).

  - Shows a broken-heart animation and a sad message.

## 💡 Notes  

- Make sure your browser allows **autoplay with sound**.  
- The “No 😜” button **can be clicked**, but it will try to dodge your mouse pointer first — just like your crush teasing you! 😉  
- You can change your names in the code inside the `showFloatingNames()` function.  

```js
text.innerText = "Tushar ❤️ Your Love";
